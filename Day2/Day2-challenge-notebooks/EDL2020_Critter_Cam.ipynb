    "# Challenge Exercise: Critter Cam\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective for this challenge is to turn your loudness sensor, distance sensor and pi cam into a critter cam. Critter cams are used by wildlife researchers to capture images and videos of wildlife in locations where it would be difficult to sit and wait for animal movement. They use sound, light, and movement sensors to detect an animal and then they begin to record or simply take a photograph. For more on wildlife cameras, [[click here]](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/identify-critters-and-vandals-wildlife-cameras).\n",
    "\n",
    "The critter cam will need to be able to run for a long time without slowing down, so it should only keep track of the most recent sound/distance data. Think about how you might code a program to take a distance and sound reading at a certain interval, and compare those readings to a one minute or so history of data. If the distance and sound readings were higher than the average over the history by a certain threshold, you should have your program take a photo.\n",
