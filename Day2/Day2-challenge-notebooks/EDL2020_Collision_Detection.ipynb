    "# Challenge Exercise: Collision Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge, the goal is to mimic a collision detection system like the ones that are used on most modern day cars with backup cameras. The premise is simple, as something gets closer to the distance sensor, the lights on the GoPiGo should begin to turn from green to red, and a beeping sound should play quicker and quicker as something gets closer and closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user of the program should be able to set a max\\_thresh and a min\\_thresh, that correspond to the distance at which it should start beeping, and the distance at which it is considered \"as close as it should get\" (where it would beep the most etc...). Before the max\\_thresh, the GoPiGo should not beep and the lights should be green. Beyond the min\\_thresh, the GoPiGo should be beeping as much as possible and the lights should be completely red. Between these two values the beeping and change in light color should scale linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a template to get you started. Some functions have already been provided for you and other bits of code need to be written or completed. Play around with variables like min\\_thresh, max\\_thresh, max\\_beep\\_freq, and sample\\_rate and see what combination makes for the best backup collision sensor. How would you improve this code?"
