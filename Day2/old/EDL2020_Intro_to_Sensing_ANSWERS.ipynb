This makes the data easier to work with, because in the loudness sensor's case, data where the room is \"quiet\" will be close to 1, and data where the room is \"loud\" will be much greater than one. This will make it easier to see when something loud is happening in the room\n",

These values are the red, green, blue, and alpha (clarity) values of the light. It then converts that reading to a different color system called HSV (hue, saturation, value) to make a guess about the color of the incoming light.
