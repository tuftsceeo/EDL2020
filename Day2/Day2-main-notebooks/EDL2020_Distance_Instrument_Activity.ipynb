    "# Creating an Distance Sensor Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, **we'll be trying to make an instrument out of a distance sensor, button, and speaker**. Imagine having a musical scale in front of your distance sensor, where different distances from the sensor corresponded to different musical notes. The objective of this activity is to create an instrument that could be played by placing one\\'s hand in different \"note-zones\", and then pressing a button to sound the note in that zone, just like a guitar player would finger a chord and strum the guitar to sound the note. Higher notes would be played by moving the hand closer to the sensor, and lower notes would be played by moving the hand father away.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the note-zone scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to turn the distance sensor's readings into a tone that is played, we will turn the distance sensor's readable area into a *map*. This means that different regions that the sensor can read will *map* to a corresponding musical note. A good way to do this is with a *Dictionary*. Dictionaries in Python allow us to store information with a *key* that corresponds to each piece of information. In this case, the key will be the distance at which the note's note-zone starts and the information will be the .wav file that plays the note.\n",
    "\n",
    "To split up the distance sensor's readable area into zones we will designate a min\\_dist and a zone\\_size. The min\\_dist will be the distance at which the scale starts and the zone\\_size will be the length of each zone starting from the min\\_dist. For example, our lowest zone will have a key of min\\_dist+0\\*zone\\_size and our next zone will have a key of min\\_dist+1\\*zone\\_size and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowing min\\_dist and zone\\_size to be mutable (changeable) will allow us to change the size of our scale easily without changing the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will need a function that takes a distance from the ultrasonic sensor, and determines which note-zone (from 0th to 11th) the distance falls into. This can be done with some quick math:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Subtract min\\_dist from the input distance to see \"how far up the scale our input is\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Divide that distance up the scale by the zone size to get a value for the number of zones from the start of the scale\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Round that value to the nearest zone number\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python terms, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "zone_num = round((input_dist-min_dist)/zone_size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, define a function called get\\_zone\\_num that takes a min\\_dist, zone\\_size, and input\\_dist and returns the zone\\_num (int) of the input\\_dist."
