    "# Introducing Servos\n",
    "Two servo packages were included in your kits. Take a look here: https://www.dexterindustries.com/store/servo-package/. \n",
    "\n",
    "Servos are simple motors which rotate, to which you can attach sensors for increased mobility and measurable range. The two sensors can be referenced and initialized with the following commands\n",
    "- Servo 1/Left Servo Port:  `servo_one = egpg.init_servo(\"SERVO1\")`\n",
    "- Servo 2/Right Servo Port: `servo_two = egpg.init_servo(\"SERVO2\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing the servos, you can control their degree of rotation using: `servo_one.rotate_servo()`  and `servo_two.rotate_servo()`. These functions take in one argument: \n",
    "- degrees to rotate\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, you can reset the servo by using `servo_one.reset_servo()` or `servo_two.reset_servo()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 8.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in the servo package are a few attachments. One of them can be directly attached to the shaft of the servo. For the following exercise, attach this piece to the servo so that you can more easily see the rotation of the servo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a simple program that will rotate the servo 180 degrees, run it again and see what happens"

(Watch out that the area around the paper is protected so you don't end up drawing on your table by accident!)\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. **Robot explorer - your robot is nagivating through a forest or jungle to get to a nearby village!** Set up an obstacle course for your robot using household objects. Books, boxes, etc. which will stand in for the trees and rocks along the path. Define a starting location for the robot, and an ending goal location (the village). Can you navigate from the start to the finish around the objects with your robot?\n",
    "    * What makes your obstacle course harder and easier? If you navigate through quickly, try adjusting the objects to make it harder!\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Choose your own adventure** The robot is yours to do want you want! Program the robot to do something that interests you. Clean off your desk (by adding a cardboard plow to the front). Play some music and choreograph the robot to dance to the music! (Flash the lights to the beat!)"
