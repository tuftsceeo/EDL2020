    "This notebook is designed to help users get started with the GoPiGo3. The first step is to set up your Raspberry Pi 3. Assuming your Pi is already working, you must then attach the GoPiGo (GPG) shield, powered through its 12V coax jack. Press the button next to the power jack to turn on the board, _then_ plug in the Pi's microUSB power cord. These can both be powered by the same rechargeable battery pack. You should now be ready to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software intended for use with GoPiGo is based in three packages. Each package is a class, a collection of functions called \"methods\" that allow the user to code the GPG without starting from square one.\n",
    "- The first of these classes is \"<a href=\"https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3/blob/master/Software/Python/gopigo3.py\">gopigo3</a>\". This class is the lowest-level of the three, meaning that it deals with more basic functionality, like declaring which pin the output will be sent through. This class is very important and includes several useful methods, but it is fairly difficult to use (and very difficult to get started with). This class is also undocumented, meaning that many issues you may encounter while using it cannot be easily solved.\n",
    "- The next class is \"<a href=\"https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3/blob/master/Software/Python/easysensors.py\">easysensors</a>\". This class uses parts of the _gopigo3_ class to create methods for more easily interacting with sensors, motors, and other output devices. While it is possible to solve many coding challenges with these two classes alone, this can prove to be tedious and unnecessary. Fortunately, there exists decent documentation on this class, so most of the methods are fairly straightforward.\n",
    "- The third and highest-level class of the three is \"<a href=\"https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3/blob/master/Software/Python/easygopigo3.py\">easygopigo3</a>\". This class is intended for use by beginner users, so it contains methods that may come across as somewhat juvenile or silly. Because of this, there are also many methods that make complex tasks very easy, which can save a lot of time and energy when working on larger projects. While having such high-level functionality can be useful, it also tends to limit the user's ability to customize interactions with peripheral devices. In these cases, it is best to switch to using the other two classes, allowing for more freedom at a slightly lower level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes below are structured for ease of understanding, organized into output devices and input devices. For each component, there is at least one snippet of example code. Depending on the component, these snippets may rely on the use of the _easygopigo3_ class (\"easy\") or the lower-level _gopigo3_ class (\"non-easy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this in Jupyter Notebook, there are a few more things to note:\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks are divided into cells. This means that code can be broken up into separate blocks and run in pieces, rather than all at once. To run a code cell, simply click the button to the top left corner of the cell (shaped like this: |>|). If that does not show up, you can simply select the cell and then hit the analogous \"Run\" button on the top toolbar.\n",
    "- Depending on how your code is set up, certain cells may throw errors if run out of order. In this notebook, it is very important to be sure that the initialization cell is run before anything else.\n",
    "- If your code results in a strange error that doesn't seem to make sense when you trace it back, try stopping the kernel, restarting the kernel, and reloading the page. This often resolves unexepected bugs.\n",
    "- There are many helpful keyboard shortcuts that you should familiarize yourself with through the help menu."
