    "# Finite States\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll be learning about finite states! The objective for this notebook is to get your robot to drive forward until it sees an object, at which point it should grab it using your grabber. It will take advantage of 2 different \"finite states\" to switch from driving to grabbing. A *Finite State Machine* is a model of computation based on a hypothetical machine made of one or more states. Only one single state of this machine can be active at the same time. It means the machine has to transition from one state to another in to perform different actions (from: https://medium.com/@mlbors/what-is-a-finite-state-machine-6d8dec727e2c). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our two finite states for this robot will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Driving:** driving forward while reading distance sensor\n",
    "- **Grabbing:** once we've seen an object, stop driving and try to grab it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the initialization script below** *(with your GoPiGo setup with distance sensor plugged into I2C and Servos plugged into Servo1 and Servo2 as shown)* **to get started.**"
