    "*Derived from a Lesson by Allison Earnhart*\n",

    "While **artificial intelligence** and machines that learn may sound like topics from science fiction, our modern world is full of “intelligent” machines that process data and make decisions not unlike the way humans do. Traditional computers can only perform the specific tasks for which they have been programmed. When a computer has the ability to independently make decisions without direct instruction, that is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI can employ many layers of algorithms, a process of problem-solving rules, to respond to new situations in a way that traditional computers can’t. From self-driving vehicles to spell check and predictive text, AI is assisting the world with all kinds of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is your music streaming service able to predict which new songs you’ll probably enjoy hearing? How does your social media service recognize your face even when you haven’t been tagged in the photo? These systems work with huge amounts of data and find ways to sort it into meaningful identifications for decision making -- a process called **Machine Learning** (ML). There are three methods by which computer systems learn: **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement**. In **supervised** learning, the system is given pre-identified examples to use as a reference. When the system encounters new data, it is compared to the examples to help determine the new data’s classification. With **unsupervised** learning, the system finds its own patterns when analyzing data and sorts it into logical categories. New data is compared to the patterns and categorized accordingly. Both of these methods can be supplemented by **reinforcement**, when a system can hone its accuracy by receiving feedback on whether a decision is correct or incorrect, and modifying its algorithm accordingly. Just like with humans, practice makes perfect. The more data a system learns with, the more accurate its future decisions can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to acknowledge the ethical hazards that exist with machine learning, especially on the topic of **bias**. Machines that learn from biased data sets can perpetuate that bias, causing unfair or inaccurate outcomes. Biased data sets can be anything from scientifically incomplete or statistically skewed information, to socially or morally questionable content created by people with conscious or unconscious prejudice or favoritism. AI systems are rapidly being integrated into society everywhere in fields as diverse as medical diagnoses, job applicant reviews, plagiarism detection, and criminal justice profiling. AI is an automated decision making process, which can be inequitable or even harmful when left to itself without the contextual awareness that human minds possess."

    "# Supervised Simple Classifier - Morse Code Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, **Classification**, is when a computer is expected to take some amount of data (an **observation**) and from that, determine what is happening by assigning that data a **category**. Categories are discrete words, descriptions or groups for describing the data by putting it in a group. For example, categories of vehicles could be \"trucks\", \"buses\", \"sedans\", \"coupes\", etc. there are many different examples of vehicles within each category but they all have commonalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Classification, we are showing a computer program many examples and asking the program to find the commonalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use supervised ML, the system goes through 3 main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training** - The system collects many **observations** which are matched with human provided **labels** (e.g. correct categories). \n",
    "2. **Modelling** - The system uses the training data to construct a model (e.g. find the commonalities).\n",
    "3. **Prediction** - Provided a new unlabelled **observation**, the program uses the model to determine what category or label should be applied to that observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a machine that takes a simple observation (namely, how long a button is pressed) and classifies the press types to recognize morse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the provided code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want this classifier to use the length of a button press to determine if it is a dot or dash. We collect will some number of training samples of each and take the average to finding the average length of a dot or dash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when a button is pressed, the length of that press is compared to the average length of a dot and dash. We decide with 'classifier' which (dot or dash) that press is more similar too.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add in the *model*. Look for the TO DOs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the Average Times for Dashes and Dots\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fix the `classify` function, In order to decide if the \"time\" given, is a dot or a dash, you need to calculate the number is more similiar to the dot average or the dash average. There are multiple ways to do this."

    "3. Update - Now take each center and look at all the observations assigned to it. Move that center to be in the middle of the cluster of assigned observations (the mean of their \"positions\").\n",

    "`training_data` ---- an array with 3 columns (for the R, G, and B values) and N rows where N is the number of training observations we have.\n",

    "`distances` ---- an array with K columns and N rows (each cell holding a distance between a training data point (for that row #, 0 to N-1) and  a center (for that column #, 0 to K-1). So for example, a row in the third row and the second column will contain the distance between the third training data point and the second center.\n",
